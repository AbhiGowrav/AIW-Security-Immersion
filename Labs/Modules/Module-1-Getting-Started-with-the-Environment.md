# Module 1 â€“ Getting started with the Environment

## Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to enable Azure Defender in your subscription

You will be performing the following activities to achieve the goal.

  - Login to Azure Portal to access your subscription
  - Upgrade your subscription to enable Azure Defender Plan
  - Configure data collection in ASC

## Exercise 1: Log in to Azure Portal

In this exercise you will learn how to login to the Azure Portal in the JumpVM using user credentials provided under the Environment Details to access the Azure Portal

### Instructions 

1. After the environment is provisioned successfully your browser will load up the **Lab Guide** along with a virtual machine called **JumpVM**. This virtual machine will be your platform throughout the course of the workshop. In case you do not see the JumpVM load up on the left side of the screen, navigate to the **Virtual Machines** tab on the top right of the **Lab Guide** and check the status of the virtual machine. Alternately, you can directly RDP into JumpVM using the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab.

2. All user credentials for accessing the **Azure Portal** can be viewed under the **Environment Details** tab for ease of access. Do note that the same information will also be sent to your registered email address. 

3. The Lab Guide can also be opened on a separate window by selecting the **Split Window** icon in the bottom right corner. This will result in the window detaching from the right side providing more on-screen space for your virtual machine.

### Login to Azure Portal 

1. In the JumpVM, Launch **Azure Portal** using the desktop icon.  

2. Now you should be on the **Microsoft Azure** login screen. Enter the following username and click on **Next**.  

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

3. Enter the following password and click on **Sign in**. 

   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject> 

   ![](../Images/azure-login-enter-password1.png "Enter Password") 

4. First time users are often prompted requesting access to **Stay Signed in**. If you see any such pop-up window, click on **No**.

5. If you see any additional pop-up like, You have free **Azure Advisor recommendations!** Close the window to continue the lab. 

6. Click on **Maybe Later** on the **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** window and skip the tour.
